		Hello, my name is actually Eric but I have been using the name "Lefty" as online handles for as long as I can remember. I tacked "San" at the end because I have been actively studying Japanese language and culture since January 2013 and don't plan to stop any time soon. I am a Web Developer, I will get into more detail later. This site is a tribute to things I find fun to work on. I am hosting this on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace Cloud</a> running on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails.</a>

		Okay! you can look forward to random articles I will be writing from thoughts, like a blog but not that wordpress stuff. Full Ruby on Rails deployment here. I want to make a section for interstiong people I know who create neat things. I will most definately have a section of moe inspiring things. Plus I will be incorporating a section to things I keep on my Github account to use as a copy-paste playground for interesting Style and Script problems I feel like taking on.
