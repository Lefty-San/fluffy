		It is a little over a year into my professional career in web development and I have personally seen site projects move in and out very quickly with cloud deployment. Easy transition into...I am hosting this on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace Cloud</a> with all deployment scripted out in capistrano. Combined with light server setup, for security, and with Nginx looking to a defined directory for web apps. Deploying a project at any stage of development or production is done with minimal involvment on the local side.

		Okay! you can look forward to random articles I will be writing from thoughts, like a blog but not that wordpress stuff. Full Ruby on Rails deployment here. I want to make a section for interstiong people I know who create neat things. I will most definately have a section of moe inspiring things. Plus I will be incorporating a section to things I keep on my Github account to use as a copy-paste playground for interesting Style and Script problems I feel like taking on.
